BUGS

* OK quiz overview, just list question count , not question content
* get code formatting right ( google prettyfy..?)
* implement timer
* add more question types
* what happens when "Done" is clicked?
* login/register
* add extra category "All"
* implement real search...or is it done?
* many parts missing..rating..
* have paging at top as well ( or only at top) because it becomes hard to see when content is long, and it jumps
* security: dont have answers on client!!! server must keep the correct answers!!!




-------------------------

* stretch search box to use whole length
* add "no cat" category "All"
* button "Create new" only visible when user logged in
* use repositories, keep controllers thin. inject the reps instead
* "create quiz"
